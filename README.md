In IoT communications, lightweight messaging protocols such as Message Queuing Telemetry Transport
(MQTT) are commonly used due to their minimal overhead and suitability for resource-constrained devices.
However, these protocols introduce additional complexity for security monitoring because traditional network

IDS tools are often not optimized for application-layer traffic semantics. The MQTTset dataset — which
contains labeled benign and malicious MQTT traffic — provides an important benchmark for evaluating
intrusion detection approaches designed specifically for MQTT-based IoT traffic. Using realistic IoT traffic
patterns, including both normal operation and attack scenarios, enables machine learning models to learn
discriminative features that reflect real-world behavior, improving the IDS’s ability to detect threats in MQTT
environments.[3] Evaluating IDS performance using such specialized real-world datasets is critical, as it
ensures that developed models can generalize beyond synthetic or generic traffic datasets and operate
effectively under realistic network conditions.
